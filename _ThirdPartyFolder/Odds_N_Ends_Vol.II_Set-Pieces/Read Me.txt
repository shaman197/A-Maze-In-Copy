Odds N Ends Series - Vol II Set-Pieces *****************************************

Hi and thanks for purchasing this package.
This second part of the Odds N Ends series is comprised of a series of Set-Pieces.
I've tried to create some pieces that work well visually with filling in areas that 
need lots of foliage quickly, but should still be engaging as well as fit within the
environment.
The Set-Pieces can be placed quickly and adjusted to your needs as moving, sizing and 
rotating objects is a snap.
You can also create your own Set-Pieces from the wide array of plants as you see fit.

I hope you enjoy playing around with the possibilities as you create your own worlds.

NOTES:
The Custom Shader includes an Ambient Light Power, which allows for control of how much
the Ambient light affects the foliage. I found that keeping it at a low level gives the 
foliage a "thicker" feel.

The Shader was created in Shader Forge and I have noticed Unity giving a warning that it 
cannot build a Custom UI for the Shader. This seems to be a common error that is popping 
up with Shader Forge created Shaders. But I have not found it to break anything or cause 
issues.
As is alwasy the case, if your Prefabs show up as the blue cube instead of the actual icons
simply Right-Click within the folder and select " Reimport".

If you have any issues or concerns please feel free to contact me at either thorAmes@gmail.com
or denni@dtames.com.

Again, thanks for your interest and happy creating

Thorsten
